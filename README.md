## SysEarth

What if God was a System Administrator?

What if his boss was an unreasonable prick and only gave God 7 days to create the Earth or he was fired?

With SysEarth, you have the power of God at your fingertips!  Use your programming knowledge to your advantage to achieve all of the objectives your boss sets out for you when trying to create a brand new planet, and possibly some objectives of your own along the way!

With the deadline looming, will you be able to pull it off?  What will the Earth look like with such a short deadline?  Will your co-workers help you or hurt you along the way?  Will you keep your job, and maybe even get a promotion?

The choice, and the world, is in your hands.  And your terminal.
